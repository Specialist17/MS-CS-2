In today’s information-rich world, there is no reason why going back to college should be the primary way you acquire the knowledge and skills you need to rise up the ranks in your field or to switch careers.
Higher education is important and plenty of research proves that college degrees are worth their cost. However, I also value autonomy and believe that people should be allowed to live in the way that best aligns with their lifestyle preferences and values. For most people, working full-time while in school and likely accruing debt, takes away their freedom to live life to their fullest.
Here are seven strategies that will help you improve your reputation and be offered new opportunities at work, without getting another degree.

Attending industry conferences on your own time is a great way to differentiate yourself because they facilitate an experience to help you acquire connections and knowledge that individuals who don’t attend the conference don’t have access to.
When determining which ones to attend, keep in mind that in most cases, you don’t go to conferences for the content. You go for the connections. The information you hear can be learned elsewhere; what you are paying for is the opportunity to be surrounded by talented, intelligent people with similar interests as you. Choose the conferences that focus most on the areas you’re passionate about to make connections with people who are most able to help you succeed.
Before attending conferences, set up a system to measure its return on investment. Here are some examples of measurable goals for conferences:
Agree to future meetings with three people who you can mutually benefit from sharing expertises with.
Connect with two potential clients for your company.
